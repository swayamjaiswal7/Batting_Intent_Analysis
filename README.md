# 🏏 Batting Intent Analysis - IPL 2025 (Match 46: RCB vs DC)

This project dives deep into the batting performance and intent of players during Match 46 of the IPL 2025 season between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Delhi Capitals (DC).
I perform a detailed ball-by-ball analysis using Python, focusing on uncovering batting intent, bowling strategies, and momentum shifts across different phases of the game. By examining metrics like strike rate, dot ball percentage, boundary percentage, and wicket events, this analysis aims to provide deep insights into how key players adapted their approach based on match situations.

🔹 Key highlights of this repository:

Ball-by-ball data cleaning and preparation

Over-wise and phase-wise performance breakdown

Radar charts and visualizations for batting profiles

Strategic insights into team and player performances

Whether you're a cricket enthusiast, a data science learner, or someone interested in sports analytics, this project offers a hands-on example of applying data analytics to real-world sports data.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze batting behaviors across powerplay, middle overs, and death overs to uncover insights on player intent, risk-taking, and scoring consistency.
