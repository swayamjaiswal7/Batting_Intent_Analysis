Batting Intent analysis of Match No. 46 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Delhi Capitals (DC)!

In this project, I perform a detailed ball-by-ball analysis using Python, focusing on uncovering batting intent, bowling strategies, and momentum shifts across different phases of the game. By examining metrics like strike rate, dot ball percentage, boundary percentage, and wicket events, this analysis aims to provide deep insights into how key players adapted their approach based on match situations.
