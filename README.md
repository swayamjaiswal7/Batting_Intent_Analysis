# Batting_Intent_Analysis
This project contains a batting intent analysis of Match 46 from the IPL 2025 season between RCB and DC. Using Python, I explore batting intent, phase-wise performance, and key player metrics like strike rate, dot ball %, and boundary %. The project includes data cleaning, visualizations , and actionable insights into player and team strategies.
